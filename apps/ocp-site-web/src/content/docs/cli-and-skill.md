# CLI & Skill (Coming soon)

> **Status: coming soon.** The OCP CLI and the agent skill are not on npm yet, so the
> published `@ocp-catalog/ocp-cli` package name is reserved but not installable. Everything
> below already works today — early adopters can run it straight from the GitHub repository.

The OCP CLI and the `ocp-catalog` agent skill give an agent a correct, repeatable way to
drive the protocol. The CLI returns structured JSON for both help and results, so an agent can
inspect a command and act on its output without parsing terminal prose.

## What The CLI Is For

- **The standard OCP workflow as commands.** Discover a Registration node, search or resolve a
  Catalog route, inspect the Catalog manifest, query with a manifest-declared query pack, then
  resolve a selected entry only when details or actions are needed.
- **Manifest-based request validation.** This is the part that keeps agents honest. Before a
  query leaves the machine, the CLI can load the Catalog manifest and reject anything the Catalog
  did not declare: an unsupported `query_pack`, a filter field that does not exist, invalid
  pagination, or a missing semantic query string. Instead of a failed network round-trip, the
  agent gets explicit correction details — and a default query pack is selected when one can be.
- **Public activity, not raw audit data.** `events tail` reads the redacted public Activity API
  projection so an agent can see query/resolve/sync/tooling events without touching audit payloads.
- **Skill management.** Install, update, check, or remove the local `ocp-catalog` skill for your
  agent environment.

## Try It From GitHub (early access)

Clone the repository and run the bundled CLI through the skill runner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Commerce-Protocol/OCP-Catalog
cd OCP-Catalog

# Top-level help describes the full OCP workflow
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts help

# A real discovery → search → inspect → query flow
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts registration search --registration-url https://ocp.deeplumen.io/registry --query "commerce"
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog inspect http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts events tail --activity-url https://ocp.deeplumen.io
```

The runner resolves the CLI in this order: `OCP_CLI_COMMAND`, then `OCP_CLI_BIN`, then a bundled
CLI, then an `ocp` binary on `PATH`, then `bunx @ocp-catalog/ocp-cli`, then `npx @ocp-catalog/ocp-cli`.

## Install The Skill Into Your Agent

To use the OCP workflow from an agent without keeping this monorepo around, export the standalone
skill and install it into your agent's skill directory:

```bash
# Export the standalone skill bundle from the repo
bun run skill:ocp:export

# Install / update / check / remove the skill in a local agent skill directory
ocp skill install --target both
ocp skill update --target auto
ocp skill doctor --target both
```

`--target` accepts `auto`, `codex`, `agents`, `both`, or an explicit skills directory. Once
installed, the agent follows the same CLI-first workflow described above.

## Request Validation In Practice

Add `--manifest` to a query so the CLI validates the request against the Catalog's declared
capabilities before sending it. Use `validate query` to check a proposed request with no network
call at all:

```bash
# Validate a query against a manifest without sending it
ocp validate query --manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest --query "running shoes" --filters "{\"category\":\"shoes\"}"

# Validate a query at request time (rejects unsupported packs / filters before the call)
ocp catalog query --manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest --query-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/query --query-pack ocp.query.keyword.v1 --query "running shoes"

# Validate a Catalog manifest itself against the schema
ocp validate manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest
```

## Command Reference

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `registration discover <discovery-url>` | Read a Registration discovery document and find its endpoints. |
| `registration search --registration-url <url> [--query <text>]` | Find Catalog route candidates by metadata. Does not search products. |
| `registration resolve --registration-url <url> --catalog-id <id>` | Resolve a selected Catalog id into a route hint. |
| `catalog inspect <manifest-url>` | Read a Catalog manifest: object types, query packs, filter fields, auth, endpoints. |
| `catalog query --query-url <url> [--query-pack <id>] [--query <text>] [--manifest <ref>]` | Search commercial objects with a manifest-declared query pack. |
| `catalog resolve --resolve-url <url> --entry-id <id>` | Resolve one selected entry for details, freshness, policy, and action bindings. |
| `validate manifest <file-or-url>` | Validate a Catalog manifest against the OCP schema. |
| `validate query --manifest <ref> [...]` | Validate a proposed query against a manifest before sending it. |
| `events tail --activity-url <url> [--limit <n>]` | Read the public, redacted Activity API projection. |
| `skill install / update / doctor / uninstall --target <dest>` | Manage the local `ocp-catalog` agent skill. |

Use `--api-key` when an endpoint requires authorization, and `--correlation-id` to link a command
to server-side activity events. Tracing fields stay in headers — never inside strict OCP request bodies.
